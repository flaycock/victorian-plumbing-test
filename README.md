Technical Test for Victorian Plumbing

# how to run
Inside the base folder run `npm i` to install dependencies, then `npm run dev` to run the dev environment.

# my approach
I broke my approach to this task down into sections, to be handled sequentially:
- Figure out a list of components I would need and create them
- Take the smallest child components, add their functionality, and build up from there
- Once functionality was implemented (and some base styling) move up in the chain
- After the page works as expected, go back over each component and complete styling
- Then go over the code itself to clean, add comments and refactor
